            <h2>EXPLORING CAPE MALAY CULTURE</h2>
            <img src="images/placeholder.png" data-src="images/Colorful-houses-of-Bo-Kaap-Cape-Town-750x350.jpg" alt="Colorful houses of Bo-Kaap Cape Town">
            <p>Cape Town is a melting pot of culture, and one of the most important groups to shape the city’s history is commonly referred to as the Cape Malay. 
                It’s a contentious name—people both inside and outside the community have objected to the term’s inaccuracy, and to the fact that it really originated as a term used to racially classify people under the oppressive apartheid regime. 
                To fully understand the cultural background of these people—and Cape Town today—here’s a look at how the culture arrived, evolved, and became one of Cape Town’s unique and distinct cultural groups.
                <br>
                It all begins in 1652 when the Dutch arrived in the Cape to establish a port for their vessels to stop at on their way to the East Indies. 
                The Dutch needed labourers for the growing port and began bringing in slaves from their colonies in the Indonesian archipelago, as well as parts of Africa. 
                These slaves were the first to bring Islam to the Cape and included political dissidents opposed to the Dutch presence in Southeast Asia.
                <br>
                From tragic beginnings, Cape Malay has emerged as a strong culture of its own distinct from the Asian, African, and Dutch cultures that have influenced it. 
                The community has a tumultuous history ranging many years, from fighting slavery to resisting their classification under the apartheid government, 
                and playing important roles in the struggle against the unjust former regime.

            <h2>CELEBRATE 333 YEARS OF GROOT CONSTANTIA WINES</h2>
            <img src="images/placeholder.png" data-src="images/Groot-Constantia-scenery-750x350.jpg" alt="Groot Constantia scenery">
            <p>Groot Constantia is South Africa’s oldest wine estate, and in 2018 it celebrates 333 years of wine-making. The estate has so much to offer: rich history, spectacular views, excellent restaurants, and, of course, award-winning wines. 
                It’s an essential stop on your Cape Town itinerary.
                <br>
                On 13 July 2018 Groot Constantia celebrated its 333rd year of uninterrupted wine production. On this day over three centuries ago the original title deed for the farm was signed.
                Since then, Groot Constantia has risen to make some of the world’s most famous wines, including the historic Grand Constance – a sweet wine first produced during the Napoleonic era. 
                The Cloete Cellar on the estate sells the wine, and hosts a tasting room and a museum where you can see a 195-year-old bottle.

            <h2>THE GUIDE TO CYCLING IN CAPE TOWN</h2>
            <img src="images/placeholder.png" data-src="images/cycling-cape-town.jpg" alt="cycling cape town">
            <p>Cape Town is at the forefront of South Africa’s biking revolution, with a host of new bike lanes, dozens of epic mountain-biking trails, and home to some of the continent’s biggest cycle races.
                <br>
                Whether you want to bike to commute or to explore some of the City’s beautiful natural spaces on two wheels, there is an option for you. 
                If you ride a bike around town, remember to ride on the left-hand side of the road, and use hand signals to indicate. Woodstock, the City Bowl, 
                and a number of other areas have clearly demarcated cycle lanes which make the experience much easier.
